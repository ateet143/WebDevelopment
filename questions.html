          Analysis focuses on looking into the problem and what needs to be done rather than coming up with a solution. For instance, how will a new computerised library information system be used? "Analysis" is a broad word that is best defined, like "requirements analysis," which is a look into what is needed, or "object analysis," which is a look at what is there (an investigation of the domain objects).
          Design focuses on a conceptual solution that meets the needs rather than how it will be put into action. For instance, a description of a database schema and software objects. In the end, designs can be put into action.
          As with analysis, the term is best used with a qualifier, such as "design of an object" or "design of a database."

          •	Functional features such as the services or operations that the website will offer.
          •	Visual appearance, which includes the user interface, colours, buttons, and other elements of visual design.
          •	Security parameters, which describe how the website will enable secure access control and transactions.

          Hierarchical model: One of the most prevalent styles of site architecture is the hierarchical model. The hierarchical architecture is frequently utilised in online applications with a huge amount of data. The hierarchical architecture, like a tree, has a trunk (like a homepage) that branches out into categories and pages. CNN.com and BBC.co.uk are excellent examples of hierarchical models.
          Sequential model: Sequential models are often used to walk users through a process step by step, like when they are being onboarded or when they are making a new account. This model can be used by UX designers to make flows for a process. Each page on wikiHow.com is a good example of a page that was made with order in mind.
          Matrix model: One of the oldest types of site structure on the internet is the matrix model. This model is different and doesn't act like other models. A structure that looks like a matrix lets users choose where they want to go next. The best way to get around these kinds of sites is to use search or internal links. The matrix model is shown very well by Wikipedia.
          Database model: A database model is a way to structure a website that changes over time. To build a website structure like this, designers should think about the bottom-up method, which involves looking at a page's metadata and following best practises for information architecture and taxonomy. Medium.com is a great example of a database model because of its posts and pages.

          The user interface must be safe, easy to use, and able to grow. Security requirements include keeping authorisation information safe from people who shouldn't be able to see it, keeping customer information private, and keeping track of payments in progress. It is also important to make sure that each party is safe from fraud. The user interface should be quick to use and easy to understand.

          Control Structures define programme flow. Logic or control structures make any algorithm or programme clearer and more understandable. It evaluates programme parameters and situations to determine programme flow.  There are three basic types of logic, or flow of control, known as: 
          •	Sequence logic, or sequential flow 
          •	Selection logic, or conditional flow 
          •	Iteration logic, or repetitive flow

          Design process is called structured design. An algorithm can be developed using simple design concepts, pseudo-code, and flowcharts.
          •	Sequence, which implies executing blocks of instructions in order 
          •	Selection, also called alternation or conditional branch; the algorithm must choose one of the alternate paths 
          •	Repetition, also called loops, is a set (or block) of instructions that are executed zero, one, or more times
          •	Input-output meaning variable values are taken from an input device (keyword) or output device (results) (screen)

          Functionality Testing: Test for – all the links in web pages, database connections, forms used for submitting or getting information from the user in the web pages, Cookie testing, etc.
          Usability Testing: Usability testing is the process of measuring a system's human-computer interaction features and identifying flaws for remedy. Usability Testing includes the following:

          •	The website should be easy to use.
          •	The instructions provided should be very clear.
          •	Check if the instructions provided are perfect to satisfy its purpose.
          •	The main menu should be provided on each page.
          •	It should be consistent enough.

          Interface Testing: The server-side interface should be tested when testing a website. You can do this by making sure the communication is done right. It should be made sure that the server works with the software, hardware, network, and database.
          The main interfaces are:
          •	Web/app server interface
          •	Application server/Database server interface.
          •	Check all server interactions and error handling. If the database or web server provides an error message for an application server query, the application server should catch and display it.
          •	Check what happens if a transaction is interrupted. What happens if the webserver connection is reset?

          Compatibility Testing: testing is done to test whether it is compatible with all the browsers, operating system, devices, and printing options.

          Performance Testing: The web application should sustain a heavy load. Web performance testing should include Web Load Testing and Web Stress Testing.

          Security Testing: The final level of web application testing protects your app from unwanted access and viruses. Web application security testing includes several steps:
          •	Test unauthorised access to secure pages
          •	Ensure active sessions are ended after user inactivity 
          •	Verify the application's SSL 
          •	Ensure restricted content cannot be downloaded without authorisation

          Learning HTML: HTML is an easy-to-learn coding language. HTML defines website front-end content structure.HTML is used to construct headings, links, and paragraphs. Each HTML element has an opening tag, a closing tag, and content.

          Help With an Open-Source Project: Joining an open-source project can help you master coding techniques. These projects don't require you to accomplish more than you want. If you challenge yourself, these possibilities are a terrific way to learn code and concepts. Fixing issues or helping finish a project can be a great learning experience.
          Learning CSS: CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, comes after HTML. CSS describes how HTML components are rendered. It specifies page layouts, colours, and fonts. HTML and CSS give websites style. Your website is like a house. HTML is your living room's drywall while CSS is the purple paint.
          Optimize All Your Images: Compressing and optimising photos might boost your website's performance. A slow website can lose customers. Free and paid programmes make it easy to compress photos, so they load faster in browsers.
          Test Your Site as You Build It: Coding can be difficult enough without having to deal with a bunch of extra problems when you're trying to finish up a project. To avoid being bombarded by a bunch of bugs, it's a good habit to test your site on multiple browsers as you build it.

          A server uses authentication when it needs to know who is accessing their information or site. When a client wants to know that the server is the system it purports to be, it uses authentication. The user or machine must confirm its identity to the server or client during authentication.
          A web proxy between users and the Internet enforces web security. This appliance can be on-premises, cloud-based, or web-browser-based. All that counts is that an employee's PC sends all Internet-bound traffic through web security.
          Between a web user and the Internet, the web security solution has extensive visibility and control over web traffic. All application-layer communication can be examined for harmful content or policy violations. Approved traffic can continue, while other traffic is dropped.

          HTTP is a set of rules for sending files like text, images, sounds, videos, and other multimedia files over the web. When a person opens their web browser, 
          they are using HTTP in an indirect way. HTTP is an application protocol that runs on top of the TCP/IP suite of protocols, which are the basis of the internet. 
          HTTP/2 is the most recent version of HTTP. It came out in May 2015. It is an alternative to HTTP 1.1, but it does not make HTTP 1.1 useless.

          Session management is used to make sure that a user's interactions with a service or application are safe. It is used to handle a user's requests and responses in a certain order. 
          When a user has an open session with a web application, they send requests during that session, and they often send information that could be sensitive. 
          The application may save this information and/or keep track of the user's status across all requests during the session. More importantly, the application must have a way to keep private information about each user safe, especially during authenticated sessions.

          A stateless programming is a software that doesn't save client data made in one session so that it can be used in the next session with the same client. 
          Each session is run as if it were the first, and answers don't depend on what happened in a previous session. A stateful application, on the other hand,
          remembers information about each client session and uses that information the next time the client makes a request.

They might, for example, carry out a series of read or write operations, arithmetic operations, or assignments to variables.
          •	Design control structure: Depending on whether a condition is true or false, the decision control structure may skip the execution of an entire block of statements or even execute one block of statements instead of another.
          •	Loop control structure: this is a control structure	 that allows the execution of a block of statements multiple times until a specified condition is met.

          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a set of symbols or codes that are used to mark up a file that will be shown on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to show the words and pictures on a web page.
          Each piece of markup code that goes between "<" and ">" is called an element, though many people also call it a tag. Some elements come in pairs that show when an effect on the screen should start and when it should stop.

          CSS is one of the most important languages on the open web, and all Web browsers use the same rules for it. Before, different parts of the CSS specification were made at the same time, which made it easy to keep track of the latest recommendations. You may have heard of CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4. Instead, everything is now just CSS without a version number.

          Syntax means the rules that show how a language is put together. In computer programming, syntax is the rules for how the symbols, punctuation, and words of a programming language are put together. Without syntax, it's hard to figure out what a language means or how it works.
          A programming language is an artificial language used to operate machines, especially computers. Programming languages utilise syntactic and semantic rules to define structure and meaning.
          Programming languages are used to express algorithms and organise and manipulate data. Some authors limit "programming language" to those that can express all algorithms; "computer language" is frequently used for more limited artificial languages.
